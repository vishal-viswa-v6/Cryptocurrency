    "#### A blockchain consists of blocks, which is the cointainers that store data and chain, where each block is linked to the previous one via a cryptographic hash. The nodes are independent computers that maintain and validate the blockchain. Consensus mechanism is a method for nodes to agree on the current state of the blockchain without trust. It works through distributed ledgers where every node has full or partial copy of the blockchain, any changes must be verified by the network. Hashing each block containing the hash of the previous block, creating a tamper evident structure, changing one block can lead to all future hashes breaking, making fraud easy to detect. Consensus algorithms are nodes following rules to agree on which new block should be added to the chain. Immutability is once data is on the chain and validated, it is nearly impossible to alter due to cryptographic and economic constraints. "

    "#### A consensus mechanism is a set of rules and processes used by a decentralized network to agree on the state of the blockchain, specifically which new block should be added next. Without a central authority, blochains rely on consensus to prevent double spreading, validate transactions and maintain a single version of truth. Proof of work is a consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin, where miners solve mathematical puzzles and earn the right to append a new block. Proof of Stake, used by ethereum chooses validators to propose and vote on new blocks based on how much crypto they have staked. Delegated proof of stake is when token holders vote for validators to secure their network."
